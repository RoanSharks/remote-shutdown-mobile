# Mobile App Setup Instructions

## What I've Created

I've converted your desktop Tkinter application into a mobile app using Kivy framework. Here are the files created:

1. **mobile_controller.py** - The main mobile app with touch-friendly UI
2. **mobile_requirements.txt** - Python dependencies needed
3. **buildozer.spec** - Configuration for building Android APK

## Features of the Mobile App

-   **Touch-optimized UI** with larger buttons and better spacing
-   **Scrollable instructions** section that works well on mobile screens
-   **Popup confirmations** for critical actions like shutdown
-   **Status updates** with color-coded messages
-   **Responsive layout** that adapts to different screen sizes
-   **Same functionality** as the desktop version

## How to Run and Test

### On Desktop (for testing):

1. Install Kivy: `pip install kivy requests urllib3`
2. Run: `python mobile_controller.py`

### Build for Android:

1. Install buildozer: `pip install buildozer`
2. Navigate to the controller folder
3. Run: `buildozer android debug`
4. The APK will be created in the `bin` folder

### Build for iOS (requires macOS):

1. Install kivy-ios: `pip install kivy-ios`
2. Run: `toolchain build python3 kivy`
3. Create Xcode project: `toolchain create YourApp /path/to/your/app`

## Key Differences from Desktop Version

1. **UI Layout**: Uses BoxLayout and GridLayout instead of Tkinter frames
2. **Threading**: Uses Kivy's Clock.schedule_once for UI updates from background threads
3. **Popups**: Custom popup dialogs instead of messagebox
4. **Touch Input**: Optimized button sizes and spacing for touch interaction
5. **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen orientations and sizes

## Quick Start

1. Copy the mobile_controller.py to your phone or run it on desktop for testing
2. Update the TARGET_URL and ADMIN_TOKEN if needed
3. The app works the same way as your desktop version

The mobile app maintains all the security and functionality of your original controller while being optimized for mobile devices!
